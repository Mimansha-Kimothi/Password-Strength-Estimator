# Password-Strength-Estimator

# Features:
<br> Password Input: Allows users to enter a password to be evaluated.
<br> Strength Estimation: Displays the strength of the password as "Weak," "Moderate," or "Strong."
<br> Show Password: Provides an option to display the entered password in plain text.
<br> Accuracy Calculation: Evaluates the accuracy of the password strength estimator using a predefined set of test passwords and their expected strengths.
