# Password-Strength-Estimator
This Java project provides a simple graphical user interface (GUI) application that estimates the strength of a given password. The password strength is determined based on its entropy, which is calculated from the character set size and password length.
# Features:
Password Input: Allows users to enter a password to be evaluated.
Strength Estimation: Displays the strength of the password as "Weak," "Moderate," or "Strong."
Show Password: Provides an option to display the entered password in plain text.
Accuracy Calculation: Evaluates the accuracy of the password strength estimator using a predefined set of test passwords and their expected strengths.
